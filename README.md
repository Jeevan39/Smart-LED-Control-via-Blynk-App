## Components Required
| Component | Quantity | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| ESP32 Board | 1 | Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller |
| LEDs (Red, Green, Blue) | 3 | Output indicators |
| Jumper Wires | As needed | Circuit connections |
| Smartphone with Blynk App | 1 | IoT control interface |

## **Blynk App Setup**
- Create a new template in the Blynk App.
- Add three Button Widgets connected to V0, V1, and V2.
- Label them Red, Green, and Blue respectively.
- Set each button to Switch Mode.
- Copy your Template ID and Auth Token into the Arduino code.
- Upload the code and watch the LEDs respond instantly!

---

**Working Principle**
- ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi.
- The Blynk App communicates with the cloud server.
- Pressing a button on the app sends a virtual pin signal (V0, V1, V2).
- ESP32 receives the signal and toggles the corresponding LED ON/OFF.

---

## **Future Scope**
- Extend to full home automation (fans, bulbs, smart plugs)
- Add voice control via Alexa/Google Assistant
- Integrate sensors (motion, temperature, humidity)
- Use secure communication (MQTT + TLS/HTTPS)

---

## **Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrates a **Smart LED Control System** using **ESP32** and **Blynk App**. It provides a cost-effective, scalable, and user-friendly solution for home automation using IoT technology.
